# VIRTUS
Virtus is a project that seeks to couple the Universal Design for Learning (DUA) guidelines based on the thesis PROPOSAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE
PLAYFUL BASED ON UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING "PROPUESTA PARA EL DESARROLLO DE SOFTWARE EDUCATIVO
LÚDICO BASADA EN EL DISEÑO UNIVERSAL PARA EL APRENDIZAJE"``

In the software development stage, we sought to create a playful software prototype to illustrate the
use of the proposed proposal based on the information collected in point
former. This application was developed using the prototyping methodology
allowing to generate a first version of the software from which it is expected
reproduce others, each version being fully functional and operational.
For the execution of this project several technologies of development of
Web applications. For logic that gives the server the ability to satisfy the
user requests where you get all the information that the application is
capable of providing (back-end), was made with the Java 11 programming language,
using the Sprint framework with SprintBoot technology exporting REST Apis
using Sprint Web MVC. As a database management system for the
information storage was used PostgreSQL 13 which interacts with the database
Integrated SprintData JPA data file. For the application interface which would be used by the
users to access information and interact with the application (front-end) was used
the Angular Framework in its version 13, with a navigation between pages by means of
of Angular Router, as well as sending and receiving HTTP requests with Angular 13
Client and PrimeNG as a collection of interface components. as environment
integrated development of JetBrains company software with academic license:
Intellij, DataGrip and Webstorm. And finally deploying it in a Docker container
hosted on a Centos7 public server provided by the UTEQ under the web address
